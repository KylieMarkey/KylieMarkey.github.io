<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>My name is Kylie Markey and I am the owner of Café Pawlatte. I wanted to combine my love for coffee with a service to help dogs in community shelters to get more exposure to increase adoption rates. It is our mission to find the best homes for each and every dog in an Omaha/Metro shelter.<p>
